# Matlab-8-Bit-Unsigned-Basic-Operations-With-7-Segment-Display
This is a matlab model that performs 8 bit unsigned basic operation with 7 segment display using Logic Gates.


## Start the Project
Please download the Matlab Simulink first before proceeding. <br/>
Inside Project folder , get the three files inside. Be sure to put the three files in one folder before going to the next step. <br/>
Open matlab. Open or Import project.slx. <br/>

## Usage
1. Change the value of the three Constants block in main project.slx . Input A is number 1 , Input B is number 2 , and Operator is the operation to be used.<br/>
Input A and B will only be in range (0-255) . For operator:
* 1 - Add
* 2 - Subtract
* 3 - Multiply
* 4 - Divide

2. Click Run Model.
3. The answer will be displayed in 7 segment display.
